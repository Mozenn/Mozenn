### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am Gauthier, a 24 years old software engineer at Lyra Network and indie game developer living in Toulouse, France.
I love creating things, from games to software to world bulding and much more.
I have tinkered with many technologies and can be defined as a T-shaped engineer, but I am more focused on backend technologies like the Java ecosystem and DevOps technologies and practices such as CI/CD or automation at the moment.

I am also working on a game since more than three years as a solo developer at https://github.com/WiseMooseGames.
