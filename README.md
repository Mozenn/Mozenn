### Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I am Gauthier, a 25 years old software engineer at Lyra Network and indie game developer living in Toulouse, France.
I love creating things, from games to software to world bulding and much more.

I have tinkered with many technologies and can be defined as a jack of all trades. I worked primarily on web backend technologies like the Java ecosystem, DevOps technologies and practices such as CI/CD or automation, and Cloud Native Applications, but I am currently shifting from web development to game development, with a focus on engine and graphics programming. 

I am also working on a game since more than four years as a solo developer at https://github.com/WildMooseGames.
