26 years old software engineer living in France.

I worked primarily with backend technologies like the Java or Node.js ecosystem, DevOps technologies, and practices such as CI/CD or automation, and Cloud Native Applications. 

I also have some experience in frontend with technologies such as JS Vanilla, Typescript, React.
