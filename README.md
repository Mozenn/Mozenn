25 years old software engineer at Lyra Network and indie game
developer living in Toulouse, France.
Passionate about creation, innovation, and problem-solving.

I worked primarily on web backend technologies like the Java ecosystem, DevOps technologies, and practices such as CI/CD or automation, and Cloud Native Applications. I am currently shifting to game development, with a focus on engine and graphics programming. 

I am also working on a game at https://github.com/WildMooseGames.
